# CSCI130-Lab3, Intro to Scientific Programming
Prompt:
1. Write a program that reads in three integers and then determines and prints the largest and the smallest integers in the group. 
2. Write a program that reads an integer and determines and prints whether itâ€™s odd or even. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. An even number is a multiple of two. Any multiple of two leaves a remainder of zero when divided by 2.]  
3. Write a program that reads in two integers and determines and prints if the first is a multiple of the second. [Hint: Use the remainder operator.] 
4. Write a program Have the user enter an integer value. State whether that value is, or is not, a multiple of 5. IF the value is a multiple of 5, then state if it is even or odd.
